= gh invite

A https://cli.github.com/:[GitHub CLI] extension that lets you send and accept GitHub repository invites without going through the GitHub website, emails, and sudo mode prompts.

TIP: To temporarily use the GitHub CLI as another user, you can set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to a personal access token.
For example, using Fish in macOS with the personal access token in the pasteboard: `set -gx GITHUB_TOKEN (pbpaste)`
